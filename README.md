# Homework 8 - Short Report about Visualization of Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

In this short report, Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn database was investigated. As a first step, effect of
features on the diagnosis (target: Maleign (as 0) or Benign (as 1)) was observed. There are 30 features in this dataset, and 
after plotting each feature against diagnosis, 10 features among them based on their distinctive data distribution against 
diagnosis was selected and presented in Figure 1 below. 20 features were eliminated because their distribution was not clear to identify any region that 
allow us to differentiate particular diagnosis.
